This analysis reproduces and refines [a graphic of the falling startup survival rates](https://github.com/behavioral-ds/online-diversity/blob/main/scripts/plot_fig6.R) from [McCarthy et al. 2020](https://github.com/behavioral-ds/online-diversity).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(here)
library(themes360info)
```

This data comes "wide", with columns for each month's observation. We're going to pivot it long,
then calculate the age of startups at any given time.

```{r}
#| label: tidy

survival <-
  read_csv(here("data", "species-survival.csv")) %>%
  rename(birth_year = "...1") %>%
  pivot_longer(-birth_year, names_to = "time", values_to = "survived") %>%
  # calculate the age at any given moment
  mutate(
    birth = ymd(paste0(birth_year, "-01-01")),
    time = ymd(paste0(time, "-01")),
    age_yrs = (birth %--% time) / years(1)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(survived)) %>%
  select(birth_year, time, age_yrs, survived) %>%
  print()
```

Now, let's visualise it! To increase clarity, let's put the focus on the first year, 2005, and on the most current, 2019:

```{r}
#| label: vis

hl_years <- c(2005, 2018)

line_colours <-
  rep(colours_360("darkgrey"), length(unique(survival$birth_year))) %>%
  set_names(unique(survival$birth_year))
line_colours["2005"] <- "#2166ac"
line_colours["2018"] <- "#e41a1c"

survival %>%
  mutate(
    year_alpha = if_else(birth_year %in% hl_years, 1, 0.15),
    year_width = if_else(birth_year %in% hl_years, 1.5, 0.75),
    ) %>%
  {
    ggplot(.) +
      aes(x = age_yrs, y = survived, colour = factor(birth_year), group = factor(birth_year)) +
      geom_line(aes(alpha = year_alpha, size = year_width)) +
      annotate_360_glasslight(
        x = 5, y = 0.8, size = 5, hjust = "left",
        label = paste0(
          "Around **half** of the startups that began in <span style=\"color:",
          "#2166ac", ";\">**2005**</span><br>",
          "are still around 15 years later...")) +
      annotate_360_glasslight(
        x = 5, y = 0.4, size = 5, hjust = "left",
        label = paste(
          "... but since then fewer and fewer startups",
          "have survived their first few years.", sep = "<br>")) +
      annotate_360_glasslight(
        x = 1.5, y = 0.15, size = 5, hjust = "left",
        label = paste(
          "**Fewer than 10%** of the startups from <span style=\"color:#e41a1c;\">**2018**</span>",
          "were still around just two years later.", sep = "<br>")) +
      scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent()) +
      scale_alpha_identity() +
      scale_size_identity() +
      scale_colour_manual(values = line_colours, guide = NULL) +
      theme_360() +
      theme(
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank()) +
      labs(
        x = "Startup age", y = "Survival rate",
        title = toupper("STARTUP SURVIVAL"),
        caption = paste(
          "**CHART:** James Goldie, 306info",
          "**ADAPTED** from McCarthy et al. 2020",
          "doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249993", sep = "<br>"))
  } %>%
  save_360plot(here("out", "startup-survival.png"), shape = "sdtv-landscape")
